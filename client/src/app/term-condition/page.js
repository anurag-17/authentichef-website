              including the Food Safety Act 1990, the Food Hygiene (England)
              Regulations 2013, the Food Information Regulations 2014, and the

              to meet the legal standards or violates any applicable food safety
              regulations. However, since we only act as a marketplace
              intermediary and are not directly involved in the sourcing,

              exclude all liability, to the fullest extent permitted by law, for
              any damage, loss, or injury arising from a Chef alleged or actual
              non-compliance with the expected standards of food safety and
              hygiene. Notwithstanding the above, we agree to cooperate fully
              with the regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies in
              the event of any food safety incidents or investigation.

              delivery date and cost before you confirm your order so that you
              may make an informed decision. In cases where delivery is
              facilitated by a third-party delivery partner, we have established
              strict guidelines to ensure that they meet our standards for
              reliability, timeliness, and professionalism. In the latter event,
              we cannot be held responsible for any issues or concerns that may
              arise during the third-party delivery partner. However, we will
              work with you and the delivery partner to resolve any issues in a
              fair and timely manner.
